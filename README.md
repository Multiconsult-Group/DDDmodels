# DDDmodels
## Hydrological models based on the principle of distance distribution dynamics (DDD)
Distance distribution dymamics (DDD) rainfall-runoff models have been developed with the aim of reducing the number of free, calibrated model parameters to a minimum. Subsurface- and runoff dynamics are parameterised from catchment distance distributions and estimates of water celerity (subsurface flow, overland flow and streamflow), and not from calibration against runoff. A GIS analysis determines the shape of linear reservoirs from the distance distributions. Celerities, and hence the scale of the linear reservoirs, can be estimated from a recession analysis or from model calibration against recession events. The models for natural catchments (the DDD model) and for urban areas (the DDDUrban) keep track of the moisture input for 10 elevations zones of equal area, so the spatial distribution, accumulation and melt of snow is carried out independently for each elevation zone. Snow melt and evapotranspirations are estimated using an energybalance model, where each of the energy elements are estimated using proxy models. The DDD model has been used operationally at the Flood Forecasting Service at the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate since 2013.

The files located at this site should let you run the model for the sample catchments (88.4, a catchment located at the western part of Norway). There are two main R scripts: "Run_DDD_Modul_EB_Oct2018.r" and "DDD_Modul_EB_Oct2018_func.r", where the former calls on the latter (the main program). In addition there are many subroutines (stored in Functions.zip) which are loaded with the "Run.." script. In the "Run.." script you can set various controls, so that you can calibrate the model, run it from states, update etc. Not all of these controls are fully operational since the development of the DDD model is an ongoing project. Running the model (kal=0) and calibrating the model (kal=1) work fine.
