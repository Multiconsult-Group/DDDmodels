# Function for calculating the Overland Flow (OF only) due to limited infiltration capacity. Distribution of water to 
# differnt groundwater layers according to their individual level of saturation and additional overland flow that may
# come from saturation from below is calculayted later and comes after evaotranpiration
# and updating the soilmoisture.

# ddist provides the weights to distribute outx to different layers
# The sum of ddist[1:NoL] is always 1 and the higher ddist the more water is received by the layer
# This subroutine takes into account Infiltration capacity ICap
